# iOS Application Development Using Objective C
## from Zero to Hero -- a personal adventure

This will be a book about iOS and iPhone application development,
from a beginner's perspective.

The idea popped out in a [Jive](http://jivesoftware.com) hack day.
Since [I like writing things](http://o2js.com) and [I already am publishing an ebook on how to be a JavaScript RockStar](http://o2js.com/interview-questions),
and I learn while I write, or in other words, I learn by writing; then why not start writing a book about Objective C?

In deed I see my current lack of Objective C knowledge as a "competitive advantage"; it will help me exprees things from a beginner's perspective, and you can
literally observe the code evolve, while my Objective C knowledge also evolves.

This will be a book about iOS and iPhone application development 
from a beginner's perspective.

You can navigate to the projects folder.
Currently it is just my naive tests, trying to understand how "everything Objective C" works.
And in a year from now, it will be the complementary source code of a full blown book.

I will use markdown to author the book and use [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/epub.html) to organize it (like to add footnotes, sections and such)


Wanna join in ;)
You are more than welcome to.
